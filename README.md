## About The Project

This project clones The [Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/), a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

The project has involved the use of Grid and FlexBox for positioning of HTML elements to satisfy responsivenes of the page on different
screen sizes.

More on responsiveness, it incorporated the use of media queries, which is a powerful tool that helped in inclusion of block CSS properties only if a certain condition is true, i.e. a particular media screen size which are refered to as breakpoints.
